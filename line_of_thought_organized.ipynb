    "1. Dataset\n",
    "  - Use the [Anime Recommendations Database from Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/CooperUnion/anime-recommendations-database). This dataset contains\n",
    "information on various anime, including user ratings, genres, and other relevant\n",
    "attributes.\n",
    "2. Data Endpoint\n",
    "  - Your service should have an API endpoint to query the dataset\n",
    "3. Classical Recommendation System\n",
    "  - Build a recommendation system that utilizes the dataset to suggest top k anime\n",
    "for a user based on their viewing history and preferences.\n",
    "  - Ensure that the recommendation logic excludes recently viewed items (e.g.,\n",
    "anime watched within the last 7 days).\n",
    "4. Contextual LLM-Based Personalization\n",
    "  - Implement a feature where users can get personalized anime recommendations\n",
    "based on a natural language description of their current mood or preferences\n",
    "(e.g., \"I want something uplifting and adventurous\").\n",
